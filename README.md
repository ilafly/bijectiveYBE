# Bijective set-theoreric solutions to the Yang–Baxter equation

## Set-theoretic solutions to the Yang–Baxter equation

A pair $(X,r)$ is a *(set-theoretic) solutions to the Yang–Baxter* equation if in $X\times X \times X$ 
$$(r\times \operatorname{id})(\operatorname{id}\times r)(r\times \operatorname{id}) =(\operatorname{id}\times r)(r\times \operatorname{id})(\operatorname{id}\times r)$$
holds.

We can write $r(x,y)=(\lambda_x(y),\rho_y(x))$ for $\lambda_x,\rho_x$ maps form $X$ to $X$.

We say that the solution $(X,r)$ is *bijective* when $r$ is bijective, *left* (resp. *right*) *non-degenerate* when $\lambda_x$ (resp. $\rho_x$) is bijective for every $x\in X$.
